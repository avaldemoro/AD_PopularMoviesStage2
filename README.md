# Popular Movie Project (Stage 2)

## Overview
This project is apart of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. In this project (stage 2 of 2), we were prompted to build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 

## Running the app
This app utilizes the [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/). To run this app, you must obtain a free API key from the MovieDB website and add this following line of code to your gradle.properties file:

`API_KEY = "<INSERT API KEY HERE>";`
