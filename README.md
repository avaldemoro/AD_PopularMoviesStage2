# Popular Movie Project (Stage 1)

## Overview
This project is apart of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. In this project (stage 1 of 2), we were prompted to build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 

## Running the app
This app utilizes the [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/). To run this app, you must obtain a free API key from the MovieDB website and insert it in the JsonUtils.java file where it says `<INSERT API KEY HERE>` 

## Prompt
Your app will:
* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  * original title
  * movie poster image thumbnail
  * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  * release date
